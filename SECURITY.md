# Security Policy

The Healthcare Data Exchange team takes the security of our software products and services seriously - which includes all source code repositories managed through our GitHub organization.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please submit your report to us via email, or by using GitHub's security advisories feature, by following the steps in the [privately reporting a security vulnerability guide](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

> **Note:** An email will be provided here, before the project is made public.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

* Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.
