# Contribution Guidelines

Before you start contributing to the project, please read the following guidelines. We follow the below guidelines to contribute to this repository.

## How To Contribute

* **DO** submit all changes via pull requests (PRs). They will be reviewed and potentially merged after a peer review from at least one maintainer.
* **DO** give PRs short but descriptive names.
* **DO** write a useful but brief description of what the PR is for.
* **DO** ensure each commit successfully builds. The entire PR must pass all checks before it will be merged.
* **DO** address PR feedback in additional commits instead of amending.
* **DO NOT** submit "work in progress" PRs. Please mark them as *Draft*. A PR should only be submitted when it is considered ready for review.
* **DO NOT** mix independent and unrelated changes in one PR.
* If there is a major upgrade or a feature addition to the project, it might be a good idea to get started with a Github issue or a Github discussion to discuss the feature or the upgrade before starting a PR on the upgrade.
