The Healthcare Data Exchange is a FHIR based integration and interoperability platform to support a regional healthcare network.

The solution integrates with UK national services such as the Personal Demographics Service, and National Data Opt-Out, and provides various options to ingest data from a typical NHS organisation.

Data is mapped to the UK Core R4 FHIR profiles, and made available through a standards compliant FHIR REST API.
